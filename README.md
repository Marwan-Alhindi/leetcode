This repository documents my hands-on practice with the tech stack I’m working to master.

My learning approach focuses on two things: solving small, continuous problems/projects across each framework and building a real-world project. I’m currently developing LangPulse, which brings together most of the stack in a single application.

Here’s the tech stack I’m focusing on, along with the platforms I use to practice each part:

- Frontend Mentor (React, Tailwind, and optionally TypeScript): https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges
- LeetCode (Python, pandas, SQL): https://leetcode.com/
- Kaggle (Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch): https://www.kaggle.com/
